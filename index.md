description: Hacking explained so we can all understand the underlying concepts. In this site you'll find different tutorials and CTF's write-ups explained in gory detail (most of the time) so together we can understand and practice every aspect of the secure (or rather insecure) side of the (our) binary world.

# List of best hacking sites

# CTF Writeups
I will post in this sections all the writeups I write along the way while participating in live CTF. I think sharing this knowledge is always positive since actual competition is a source of knowledge and self-improve. Sharing this knowledge helps not only me but the whole community.

# Tutorials && Writeups
Knowledge that I consider is worth sharing. Tutorials,  walkthroughs, challenges, writeups, papers, articles... thoroughly detailed. The purpose is to understand the underlying idea and the inner workings of it. Unlike the previous section, these writeups deal with challenges that are always available, not in a given time lapse.
