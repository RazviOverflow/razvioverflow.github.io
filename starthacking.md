# List of hacking websites
Have you ever wondered where to start hacking, acquire more hacking knowledge and even train, test and improve your hacking skills? Here is a compilation, collection, list, directory of the best sites that will help you. The sites listed below will help you understand and practice every aspect of the secure (or rather insecure) side of software, networks (networking), servers and every single element that may be exposed in the(our) binary world. 

Please note that this is a mere compilation, all credits go to their respective authors. Creating such challenges requires and involves a lot of time, knowledge and creativity. Respect their work. 

The list is ordered in no particular manner.

- <span style="color:blue">Pwnable</span>  [http://pwnable.kr/](http://pwnable.kr/) Pwnable is a classic, one of all-time favorites. pwnable.kr is a non-commercial wargame site which provides various pwn challenges regarding system exploitation. The main purpose of pwnable.kr is 'fun'. While playing pwnable.kr, you could learn/improve system hacking skills but that shouldn't be your only purpose. The only thing you must do is click "play" on the upper left zone, choose a game and Pwn it. They provide a scoring system, the harder the challenge is, the more score you win.
