# List of hacking websites
Have you ever wondered where to start hacking, acquire more hacking knowledge and even train, test and improve your hacking skills? Here is a compilation, collection, list, directory of the best sites that will help you. The sites listed below will help you understand and practice every aspect of the secure (or rather insecure) side of software, networks (networking), servers and every single element that may be exposed in the(our) binary world. 

Please note that this is a mere compilation, all credits go to their respective authors. Creating such challenges requires and involves a lot of time, knowledge and creativity. Respect their work. 

The list is ordered in no particular manner.

- Pwnable [http://pwnable.kr/](http://pwnable.kr/) Pwnable is a classic, one of all-time favorites. pwnable.kr is a non-commercial wargame site which provides various pwn challenges regarding system exploitation. The main purpose of pwnable.kr is 'fun'. While playing pwnable.kr, you could learn/improve system hacking skills but that shouldn't be your only purpose. The only thing you must do is click "play" on the upper left zone, choose a game and Pwn it. They provide a scoring system, the harder the challenge is, the more score you win.
- CTFTIME [https://ctftime.org/](https://ctftime.org/) One of the biggest Capture The Flag (CTF) archives. They classify the challenges by year and profide useful information and statistics. For example, each competition participating teams, the winning team, their members, their write-ups, etc... 
- Over The Wire [http://overthewire.org/wargames/](http://overthewire.org/wargames/) Again one of all-time favorites. 
The wargames offered by the OverTheWire community can help you to learn and practice security concepts in the form of fun-filled games. To find out more about a certain wargame, just visit its page linked from the menu on the left. They have a suggested order to play the games in in their "About". 
- W3 Challenges - https://w3challs.com/ 
- Pwnable.tw [https://pwnable.tw/](https://pwnable.tw/) Pwnable.tw is a wargame site for hackers to test and expand their binary exploiting skills. Just as the .kr version (I actually don't know if they're related) the only thing you must do is click "challenges" con the upper left webpage tabs. They provide a scoring system, the harder the challenge is, the more score you earn. They also provide write-ups.
- Builds Hack Me [http://ctf.slothparadise.com/](http://ctf.slothparadise.com/) As soon as you enter the site, you will see no play button. This one is a real simulation, you must inspect source code and start digging to gather info and Pwn it :D
