Some friends and I participated in NeverLAN CTF 2020, an online CTF with entry-level challenges. The CTF overall was pretty nice, even though there were some technical difficulties and we were somewhat penalized because of the time zone. I enjoyed the experience and learned a lot. That's the most important part and where the fun really is, learning in the process. The prize or actual number one of the competition is secondary.

We solved all challenges but two of them and finished the CTF in 59th place. It's not that bad if we consider that the first 32 teams are all #1, with the maximum possible score. 

The CTF had several categories including reverse engineering, crypto, pcacp, forensics, programming, recon, web, *chicken little* and trivia. We solved a lot of challenges but, unfortunately, couldn't document them all. The writeups you can find in this page are:
