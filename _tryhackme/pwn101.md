[TryHackMe PWN101](https://tryhackme.com/room/pwn101) (Binary Exploitation) room explained step-by-step and in detail so as we understand the underlying concepts and exploitation techniques. Each challenge has its own dedicated video. I recommend watching the Intro video to better understand the context of this series.

## pwn101

Video link: [PWN101 pwn101 (BOF)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_merdYty4Y)

Abusing a call to a vulnerable function (gets) in order to perform a buffer overflow and overwrite the value of a given variable stored in the stack. Since the value of this variable is later checked in the code, by overwriting it we manage to spawn a shell.

## pwn102

Video link: [PWN101 pwn102 (BOF to overwrite memory)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DiyFDCuyPqg)

Overflowing a buffer due to the use of `scanf` function. We are overwriting memory in such a way that we're placing specific values at specific addresses hence spawning a shell.

## pwn103

Video link: [PWN101 pwn103 (ret2win)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VUtXwDm5yQ)

Hijacking the program's execution flow in order to execute a function of our choice, which is usually called ret2win (because we are returning to win() or any equivalent function) . We are abusing a buffer overflow caused by the use of scanf. A detailed explanation is given about how the stack behaves and what is happening in memory during the execution, so as to understand the underlying concepts and why this attack is possible.  A thorough explanation will be given about how RSP and RBP registers are modified by the instructions, either as a direct or side effect.

## pwn104

Video link: [PWN101 pwn104 (ret2shellcode)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Yiupj3XHrM)

Hijacking the program's execution flow in order to execute our payload, which conveniently corresponds to assembly instructions/code that spawn a shell (Shellcode), an attack that is commonly referred to as ret2shellcode or simply shellcode execution. This time we are abusing a buffer overflow caused by the misuse of read. The address of the buffer on the stack (where we want to jump to in order to execute the shellcode) is leaked by the binary itself, thus allowing us to bypass ASLR with ease. In this video ASLR and the concept of Shellcode are introduced. Detailed explanation is given as to how execute the shellcode.

## pwn105

Video link: [PWN101 pwn105 (Integer Overflow (IOF))](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mfaq4PW8H1I)

Exploiting an integer overflow so as to spawn a shell. In this video we are exploring the binary world and how the CPU treats numbers. We will discuss their representation in memory (both positive and negative numbers) and how basic arithmetic (addition and subtraction) is carried out, which will inevitably lead us to integer overflow, underflows, truncation and signedness errors.

TryHackMe Dear QA (Binary Exploitation, PWN) challenge explained in detail. We will see how to solve the challenge and understand the underlying concepts. We revisit the very foundations of a Buffer Overflow vulnerability in order to hijack the binary's execution flow.
